- The most profitable markets (by the number of orders) are the Female young adult (25-34) and the adults (35-64) groups in Australia and the Adult Females and Adult Male groups in the United States.


- Firstly, the table contains a multitude of missing values.  

When analysing each countryâ€™s profit margins, we can see that   United States has the highest total sales but also a high profit margin. Thus, it may be the most profitable market overall. 

Also, the female customers are the most profitable group due to higher profit margins, this suggests that the U.S. market is a strong performer in terms of profitability, particularly for older females (600.37%) and males (408.80%) and younger females (270.94%). Another strong market for the same gender/age groups is the Australian one. 

Also, some other remarks: 

-United Kingdom shows some promise in the Male Adults (35-64) age group with high profit margins (136.31%) and low order quantities. This indicates that more premium products are sold there. At the same time for the in the Female Young Adult age group, for the same quantity of products sold as before, the profit margin is almost 4 times smaller. This indicating that in these markets, the company may need to reconsider its pricing strategy, improve marketing efforts, or evaluate the type of bikes sold. 

-France on the other hand has the same problem as UK, but in the male Youth age group, as profit margins are low compared to the number of items sold. This indicates that the items sold are lower priced. 
#### Task 2: Regional Sales Analysis
- Built a pivot table summarising product sales by county.
- Used **SWITCH** function to categorise sales volumes:
    - **High** (> 600)
    - **Medium** (300â€“600)
    - **Low** (< 300)

#### Task 3: Visualisations Lab
- Created Excel charts based on bike sales visualisation dataset.
- Focused on exploring Excel's visualisation capabilities.
